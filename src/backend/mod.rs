//! Feature-gated, backend-specific functionality.
//!
//! Conrod can be thought of as a pipe, where its inputs are `conrod::event::Raw`s and its output
//! is `conrod::render::Primitives`. The following feature-gated backend modules provide helper
//! functionality for converting events and rendering primitives in a way that is suitable to each.
//!
//! If there is a popular backend that you would like to see support for that is currently missing
//! from this module, feel free to open an issue or pull request at the conrod repository.
