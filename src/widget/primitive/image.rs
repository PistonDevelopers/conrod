    /// Instead, image data is stored within a `conrod::image::Map` where `image::Id`s are mapped
    /// to their associated data.
    ///
    /// This is done for a few reasons:
    ///
    /// - To avoid requiring that the widget graph owns an instance of each image
    /// - To avoid requiring that the user passes the image data to the `Image` every update
    /// unnecessarily
    /// - To make it easier for users to borrow and mutate their images without needing to index
    /// into the `Ui`'s widget graph (which also requires casting types).
    ///
    /// During rendering, conrod will take the `image::Map`, retrieve the data associated with each
    /// image and yield it via the `render::Primitive::Image` variant.
    ///
    /// Note: this implies that the type must be the same for all `Image` widgets instantiated via
    /// the same `Ui`. In the case that you require multiple different types of images, we
    /// recommend that you either:
    ///
    /// 1. use an enum with a variant for each type
    /// 2. use a trait object, where the trait is implemented for each of your image types or
    /// 3. use an index type which may be mapped to your various image types.
